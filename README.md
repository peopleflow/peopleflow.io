Hey ADP - you filed a trademark on our name, in the HR space, after we worked with your organization? You weren't the first to come up with the "peopleflow" name in the use of HR data and services. As you can see, this Github repo was registered several _years_ before the filing. However; if you'd like, I still have the SSL certificates _ADP issued to us_ when we serviced Jawbone, where we were customers of the ADP ServiceNow API, providing data management and analytics services to Jawbone. The peopleflow name was used throughout those emails, so ADP was clearly aware of us _before_ filing a trademark on our name.
